Excel Challenge

This project included organizing and analyzing 4,000 Kickstarter campaigns to uncover market trends.

SHEET ONE (Data Set) includes the original data set which has been cleaned, organized, and formatted - including the following: 
  - Conditional formatting to color "state" columns pending status (successful, failed, cancelled, or live)
  - Creation of Percent_Funded column using a formula to determine how much money a campaign made to reach its goal
  - Conditional formatting to fill Percent_Funded column with a three point scale 
  - Creation of Average_Donation column using a formula to determine how much each backer paid on average
  - Split'Category and Sub-Category' column into two separate columns using a formula
  - Creation of Date_Created_Conversion and Date_Ended_Conversion columns with formulas to convert the Unix timestamps into Excel's date format 
  
SHEET TWO (Category Pivot Table) includes a pivot table that analyzes the initial worksheet to determine how many campaigns were successful, failed, cancelled, or are currently live by category.
  - Included is a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the pivot table. 
  
SHEET THREE (Sub-Category Pivot Table) includes a pivot table that analyzes the initial worksheet to determine how many campaigns were successful, failed, cancelled, or are currently live by sub-category. 
  - Included is a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the pivot table. 
  
SHEET FOUR (Pivot Table by Date) includes a pivot table using state, date created, and count of state with filters based on parent category and years. 
  - Included is a pivot chart line graph to visualize this information. 
  
SHEET FIVE (Bonus) includes a newly created chart with formulas used to determine the number of successful, failed, and cancelled projects - as well as the percentages of each - within goal ranges. 
  - Included is a line chart to demonstrate the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances of being succesful, a failure, or cancelled. 
  
SHEET SIX (Bonus Statistical Analysis) includes a new chart created to evaluate the number of backers for successful versus unsuccessful campaigns. 
  - Summary statistics table includes mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation. 
  - A second table has been added with the same calculations - yet completed via more complex formulas using the initial data set (sheet one).
